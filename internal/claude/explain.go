// explainBrief is what Haiku is asked for: the command taken apart for
// someone watching over Claude's shoulder, as explainSchema.
const explainBrief = `Explain this shell command to someone watching an AI agent run it, who wants to follow every piece.
- summary: one sentence on what the whole command does and why someone would run it.
- steps: one per command the shell runs, in order: split on ; && || and newlines, and treat a wrapper that runs a quoted script (nix-shell --run, bash -c, ssh host '…', docker exec …) as one step, its code the wrapper with the script shortened to "…" (nix-shell -p pnpm --run "…"), the quoted commands its own steps after it. For each: code (that command exactly, pipes included), what it does in plain words, and parts: every flag, argument that matters, pipe stage (| tail -2), redirection (2>&1, > file), variable or substitution in it, each with code (exactly as written) and what it does. Skip parts that are obvious (a plain file name).
- warnings: at most 3, one sentence each, only real surprises in the command itself (an exit code that reports the wrong command, output thrown away, something run with privileges, a destructive flag); empty when none. No guesses about files you weren't shown.
- effects: one sentence on what it changes (files, network, system) or that it only reads.
Write about the command, never about yourself or what you did or didn't check.
Inside the text, put any command, flag, path or variable in backticks.
